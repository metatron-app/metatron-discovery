============================================================================== 
Simba JDBC Driver with SQL Connector for Google BigQuery Release Notes 
============================================================================== 

The release notes provide details of enhancements, features, known issues, and 
workflow changes in Simba JDBC Driver for Google BigQuery 1.2.11, as well as 
the version history. 


1.2.11 ========================================================================

Released 2020-08-28

Enhancements & New Features 

 * [GBQJ-373] Avro library update
 
   The driver now uses Avro version 1.10. Previously, the driver used version 
   1.9.

 * [GBQJ-376] Updated HT API configuration
 
   For anonymous tables, utilizing storage API is free and the driver now 
   ignores the HT API ON/OFF flag in the configuration. 


Resolved Issues
The following issues have been resolved in Simba JDBC Driver for Google 
BigQuery 1.2.11.

 * [GBQJ-366] In some cases, when calling executeQuery() for a result set, 
   the driver returns an error. 

 * [GBQJ-371] When retrying failed queries, the driver encounters a rate 
   limit. 
 
   This issue has been resolved. The driver now retries failed queries
   using an exponential back-off mechanism. 
   
 * [GBQJ-375] The driver ignores the StringColumnLength property. 

 * [GBQJ-378] The DSI_MULT_RESULT_SETS connection property returns false 
   instead of true. 
   
 * [GBQJ-383] When using prepared statements to set null parameters for string
   datatypes, the driver returns a null pointer exception.
 
 
Known Issues
The following are known issues that you may encounter due to limitations in
the data source, the driver, or an application.

 * TRACE level logs incorrectly contain stack trace for function entrances.

   When logging at the TRACE level (LogLevel=6), function entrance logs are 
   generated for each function that is called. These logs incorrectly 
   include a stack trace.

 * Query prefixes are not supported.

   The driver does not support query prefixes. To specify whether your query
   statements are to be processed using standard SQL or legacy BigQuery SQL, 
   you must configure the QueryDialect connection property. 

   By default, QueryDialect is set to "SQL" so that the driver uses standard
   SQL syntax. To use BigQuery SQL instead, set the property to "BIG_QUERY".

 * Support for ODBC Escape Sequences is limited.

   The only supported ODBC Escape Sequences are Scalar Functions of the form 
   {fn func(args)} if func is supported by the Google BigQuery data source 
   engine. 

 * When casting data, you must specify the data type according to Google 
   BigQuery standards.

   When casting data to a specific data type, you must use the corresponding 
   data type name shown in the "Casting" section of the Query Reference:
   https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-reference/functions-and-operators#casting. 

   For example, to cast the "salary" column to the INTEGER type, you must 
   specify INT64 instead of INTEGER: 

      SELECT position, CAST(salary AS INT64) from Employee


Workflow Changes =============================================================

The following changes may disrupt established workflows for the driver. 


1.2.2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Removed support for JDBC 4.1 (Java 7)

   Beginning with this release, the driver no longer supports JDBC 4.1 (Java 
   7). For a list of supported JDBC versions, see the Installation and 
   Configuration Guide.


Version History ==============================================================

1.2.8 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2020-07-17

Enhancements & New Features 

 * [GBQJ-351] Location restrictions for datasets

   You can now specify a location for the driver, so that the driver only 
   queries datasets in that location. To do this, set the Location property to 
   the name of the dataset location. For more information, see the 
   Installation and Configuration Guide.


Resolved Issues
The following issues have been resolved in Simba JDBC Driver for Google 
BigQuery 1.2.8.

 * [GBQJ-359] In some cases, queries that include a newline before certain DDL 
   or DML keywords cause an exception.

 * [GBQJ-361] The getCatalogs() metadata function returns only the first 50 
   projects.

   This issue has been resolved. The getCatalogs() function now returns all 
   projects.


1.2.4 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2020-05-11

Enhancements & New Features 

 * [GBQJ-321] Support for BigQuery scripting

   The driver now supports BigQuery scripting for Standard SQL. For more 
   information, see "Scripting in Standard SQL" in the BigQuery documentation: 
   https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/scripting
   
* [GBQJ-344] Support for additional passthrough query properties

   You can now pass a property through to the server by using the
   QueryProperties connection URL. For more information, see the
   Installation and Configuration Guide.    


Resolved Issues
The following issues have been resolved in Simba JDBC Driver for Google 
BigQuery 1.2.4.

 * [GBQJ-336] In some cases, complex queries cause the driver to terminate 
   unexpectedly.

 * [GBQJ-354] In some cases, if you include comments between DDL statements, 
   the statement executes correctly but the driver generates an empty result 
   set.

 * [GBQJ-357] If you use getProcedureColumns() to retrieve Array, Struct, or 
   Geography types, the driver terminates unexpectedly.
   
 * [GBQJ-354] In some cases, if you include comments between DDL statements,
   the statement executes correctly but the driver generates an empty result
   set.  

 * [GBQJ-310] When using the Numeric data type, the REST API does not include
   leading zeros.
   
   This issue has been resolved. The driver now uses the default BigQuery
   scale of 9 for Numeric data. 
 
 * [GBQJ-310] When using the Boolean or Datetime data types, there are
   discrepancies between flat and nested columns.
   
   This issue has been resolved. The format of Boolean and Datetime data in
   nested columns now matches the format of flat columns.


1.2.3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2020-03-27

Enhancements & New Features 

 * [GBQJ-325] Support for DDL ALTER TABLE SET OPTIONS statements.

   The driver now supports ALTER TABLE SET OPTIONS statements in DDL. For 
   more information, see "ALTER TABLE SET OPTIONS" in the Google BigQuery 
   documentation:
   https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#alter_table_set_options_statement 

 * [GBQJ-302] Support for catalog metadata API calls for persistent functions.

   The driver now supports catalog metadata API calls for persistent 
   functions. 

 * [GBQJ-324] Support for CREATE, CREATE OR REPLACE, DROP statements for  
   FUNCTION and PROCEDURE. 

   The driver now supports these statements.

 * [GBQJ-327] Support for JDBC Batch Execute 

   The driver now supports JDBC Batch Execute.
   

Resolved Issues
The following issue has been resolved in Simba JDBC Driver for Google 
BigQuery 1.2.3. 

 * [GBQJ-334] Temporary tables never expire

   This issue has been resolved. Now, temporary tables expire after one hour 
   by default. You can change this expiration time by setting the new 
   LargeResultsDatasetExpirationTime connection property. For more 
   information, see the Installation and Configuration Guide.


1.2.2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2019-09-23

Enhancements & New Features 

 * [GBQJ-303] Avro library update
 
   The driver now uses Avro version 1.9.

   As a result of this update, the driver no longer supports JDBC 4.1. For 
   more information, see "Workflow Changes" in this document.


Resolved Issues
The following issues have been resolved in Simba JDBC Driver for Google 
BigQuery 1.2.2. 

 * [GBJQ-298] Some data types are returned differently in nested ARRAY and 
   STRUCT formats than they are in flat data.

   This issue has been resolved. The following data types in nested ARRAY and 
   STRUCT formats are now returned differently to match the representation 
   that would be expected if they were in flat columns:
   - BYTES
   - DATE
   - DATETIME
   - NUMERIC
   - TIME
   - TIMESTAMP

   Note: The Storage API returns NUMERIC data in a nested ARRAY or STRUCT 
   with trailing zeroes. The REST API trims the trailing zeroes.

 * [GBQJ-309] The driver incorrectly rounds BigDecimal parameter values that 
   are bound to prepared statements. 


1.2.1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2019-05-15

 * [GBQJ-291] Updated Google Cloud BigQuery Storage API
 
   The driver has been updated to use version 0.85 of the Google Cloud 
   BigQuery Storage API.


1.2.0 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2019-03-01

Enhancements & New Features 

 * [GBJQ-269] Support for the BigQuery Storage API

   The driver can now use BigQuery Storage API to more efficiently process
   large result sets. For more information, see the Installation and 
   Configuration Guide.

 * [GBQJ-273] Updated OAuth URLs

   The URLs used by the driver for OAuth authentication have been updated
   to remain current.


Resolved Issues
The following issues were resolved in Simba JDBC Driver for Google BigQuery 
1.2.0. 

 * [GBQJ-284] In some cases, when executing a query that takes a long time 
   to complete, the query fails and the driver returns a GeneralException 
   error.

   This issue has been resolved. The driver now returns a more informative
   error message if a long-running query times out.

 * [GBQJ-274] In some cases, the driver cannot retrieve arrays with primitive 
   types.
